  <h1>The Capital of Ligths and Gastronomy</h1>
  <p>
    Lyon is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, situated between Paris and Marseille. The residents of the city are called Lyonnais.
    <br> It has a significant role in the history of cinema due to Auguste and Louis Lumière, who invented the cinematographe in Lyon. The city is also known for its famous light festival, Fête des Lumières, which occurs every 8 December and lasts for four
    days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.
    <br> Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, Euronews, and International Agency for Research on Cancer.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    According to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus and Lepidus, lieutenants of the assassinated Julius Caesar and governors of central and Transalpine Gaul, respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees.
    These refugees had been expelled from Vienne (a town about 30 km to the south) by the Allobroges and were now encamped at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers. Dio Cassius says this task was to keep the two men from joining Mark Antony and
    bringing their armies into the developing conflict. The Roman foundation was at Fourvière hill and was officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to
    as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum[8]).[9] The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as "Desired Mountain" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary.[10] In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named
    Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish Lú), and dúnon (hill-fort).

  <p>
    The Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimus Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina (Blandine), Pothinus (Pothin), and Epipodius (Épipode),
    among others. In the second century AD, the great Christian bishop of Lyon was the Easterner Irenaeus.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the French Revolution, Lyon rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. In 1793, the city was assaulted by the Revolutionary armies and under siege for over two months before eventually surrendering. Several buildings were
    destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour. Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouché administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.
  </p>
  <p>
    During World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying German forces, as well as a stronghold of resistance. The traboules (secret passages) through houses enabled the local people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, the city was liberated
    by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.

  <h2>Geography</h2>
  <p>
    The Rhône and Saône Rivers converge to the south of the historic city centre forming a peninsula or "Presqu'île". There are two large hills, one to the west and one to the north of the city centre, as well as a large plain which sprawls eastward. West
    of the Presqu'île, the original medieval city (Vieux Lyon) was built on the west bank of the Saône river at the foot of the Fourvière hill. This area, along with portions of the Presqu'île and much of the Croix-Rousse is recognized as a UNESCO World
    Heritage Site.
  </p>

  <h2>Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Since the Middle Ages, the residents of the region speak several dialects of Arpitan language. The Lyonnais dialect was partly replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However, it is still alive and, in addition, some "frenchified" Franco-Provençal words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls "gones" and "fenottes" for example.
  </p>
  <h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
  <p>
    The Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the "exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.
  </p>
  <h3>Gastronomy</h3>
  <p>
    Lyon has a long and storied culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as "the gastronomic capital of the world". Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois[25] and Eugénie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favored by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a world-wide success.
